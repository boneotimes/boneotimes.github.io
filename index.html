                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Boneo Primary School is taking a leap forward in technology education by developing the SPARK.Centre, a learning space that utilizes a wide array of technology tools and platforms. The goal of the SPARK.Centre is to create an open-source template that other schools and learning spaces can fork and emulate. The SPARK.Centre will provide students with access to a range of technology tools and platforms, including GitBook, GitHub, Mobirise, IPFS, and Mark Down Editor, among others.
<br>
<br>The SPARK.Centre will also feature a team of Spark Leaders, comprising four leaders and tech ninjas, who will work alongside administrators, tech support, and helpdesk staff to manage the learning space. Taj, Lelo, Tabith, and  Lyncon are among the students who will be leading the Spark team. The group will be responsible for implementing group policies and managing applications.
<br>
<br>The learning space will feature a smart classroom that utilizes Starlink, a high-speed internet service that provides customers with download speeds of around 100 Mbps. The classroom will also feature networking fundamentals based on the CCNA certification, a mesh network, and OpenDNS filtering. Pi-Hole, an advertisement-blocking application that acts as a domain name service, will also be installed.
<br>
<br>The SPARK.Centre will provide students with a range of smart projects to work on, including robotics, Lego table building, learning Linux, game development, and drone technology. Students will also have access to digital artwork creation tools and augmented reality software.
<br>
<br>The learning space will feature a Minecraft Education Edition server setup and a VR development station that includes Mozilla Spoke and Hubs, as well as 360 photography tools such as the Insta360 One X2.
<br>
<br>Overall, the SPARK.Centre will provide Boneo Primary School students with an immersive learning experience that utilizes a range of cutting-edge technology tools and platforms. The SPARK.Centre will also serve as a model for other schools and learning spaces to emulate, helping to shape the future of education for generations to come.
